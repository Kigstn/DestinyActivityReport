# Destiny Activity Report
`Destiny Activity Report` is a static website which let's Destiny 2 players view their activity stats interactively.
Activities are queried at runtime from the bungie API, so the website will always represent the current state of the game without needing an update.

All stats are queried 100% locally from the bungie API - no data is saved nor provided by us.
